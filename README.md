The Real(Real-Fi) Guide
Foreword
How do you feel having receipts for your assets available anywhere, at any time?
What do you think about assessing the liquidity of your real-world assets with a click?
Whats your stake on accessing your real-world assets digitally, in the form of tokens?
Well, good or bad, this is freedom.
And everyone wants it.
Three years ago, while on a tour in Argentina, I bought a plot of land in Buenos Aires. I had the description, the documents, the details - and overnight, the land was mine. Yet here is the dilemma: it is not with me and of course, it can't be in my hands, but I want a version of it I can keep on my device.
Then a thought occurred. Can I lock properties to my identity and access proof of ownership anywhere, using only my wallet address, secured on the Web3 stack?.
In the current digital world, the evolution and acceptance of RealFi enable one to own real-world assets or property with robust safeguards - akin to those used by stablecoins - accessible through a wallet. It is the synergy between mainstream economic activity and decentralization in Web3.
Real-Fi and De-Fi
To understand RealFi, [DeFi](https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835) becomes relevant. DeFi is blockchain-based finance offering services like lending, borrowing, and trading without traditional intermediaries such as banks or brokerages. It uses smart contracts - self-executing programs - to automate transactions and operates peer-to-peer, providing potentially more accessible, flexible, and lower-cost services than traditional systems. Built on Web3, it enables liquidity in virtual tokens: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, and many more. Key points to know about Real-Fi

Tokenization
Tokenization converts a real-world asset or function into a digital asset on the blockchain. It involves writing a smart contract to represent a function, a duty, or a real-world asset on-chain. It is like having proof of ownership for all your properties in your Web3 wallet, with the ability to convert them into liquid cash at any point, without a middleman.
To get an idea of what I mean, imagine this scenario
I have a four-story building in Puerto Madero with 30 apartments. Friends and family want to participate; they want to invest and own a share of these 30 units. What do I do? I tokenize the building with a [smart contract](http://Here%20is%20the%20real%20promise%20of%20RealFi.%20These%20smart%20contracts%20can%20be%20applied%20to%20utility%20and%20physical%20assets%20—%20real%20estate,%20insurance%20schemes,%20company%20shares,%20and%20almost%20anything%20you%20own%20or%20can%20imagine.%20For%20liquidity%20concerns,%20RealFi%20closes%20the%20gap.%20We%20approach%20the%20real%20oceans:%20where%20real%20assets%20meet%20liquid%20markets.) - code as receipt - creating 30 tokens corresponding to each apartment. I transfer ownership to interested parties and they hold a long-term investment. Ownership is split into 30 distinct pieces and can be shared with 30 different people or wallets, and even more if subdivided further.
This is how tokenization works.

Once an asset is tokenized, several considerations arise before investing. Chief among them is security. In RealFi, the tokenized record of your physical asset is inscribed on the blockchain and secured by your seed phrase. Malicious transactions are not possible without your consent.
Chain securityDecentralization
Finance in Web3 is decentralized and requires agreement only between counterparties - sender and receiver, buyer and seller. It is not the conventional system that relies on agencies to charge fees, often with limited encryption of transaction details. RealFi bridges the gap between the cryptocurrency realm and traditional finance (TradFi).
Liquidity
Liquidity is a major advantage of RealFi. Have you ever needed cash and been unable to obtain it - not because you lack assets, but because you lack a counterparty to transact for liquid, exchangeable money? If yes, RealFi is a practical solution. All you need is a robust tokenization system for real-world assets - the real deal in RealFi.

Here is the real promise of RealFi. These smart contracts can be applied to utility and physical assets - real estate, insurance schemes, company shares, and almost anything you own or can imagine. For liquidity concerns, RealFi closes the gap. We approach the real oceans: where real assets meet liquid markets.
